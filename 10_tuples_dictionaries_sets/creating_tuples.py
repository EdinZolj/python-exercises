# Tuples groups related pieces of data together.
# It helps us to group different pieces of data that belong together (closely-related data).
# We group tuples similarly to list, but we use () instead of {} around the values.
# We us commas , to separate values in a tuple.
# Special case: Tuples with only one value end in a comma anyway.
